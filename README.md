# Helsinki University database project app made with Java

This app was the final project for the Helsinki University Open University course AYTKT10004 Introduction to Databases.

The course focus was on SQL, so doing the SQL exercices (completed 100/100) and having functional SQL queries for the final project was my focus. Thus, the code is not the prettiest. I opted to use Microsoft Azure SQL services instead of running a local database and have omitted the server settings from the source code. This turned out not the be the smartest of ideas as the network performance and the testing tier Azure DB performance bottlenecked the performance tests when doing indexed vs. not indexed testing we were required to conduct.

Final report coming at some point.
